EMNLP 2018 is underway, and I am in Brussels with many of my collaborators. 
There are over 2500 participants, making it the largest NLP conference ever,
with scientists from all over the world. These are exciting times for the 
field of natural language processing.

But let's look slightly further ahead: What will EMNLP look like in a 
decade?

The context for this question is the recent 
[special report](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/) from the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which states the facts in plain 
terms: catastrophic climate change is inevitable; it will destabilize 
ecosystems and societies; and to stand even a chance of averting far 
worse outcomes, we must cut worldwide carbon emissions in half over the 
next decade---and then keep cutting them. To accomplish this, we will need 
to remake modern society at all levels, from global to individual. 

Remaking society at a global level will require sustained, coordinated 
action across all sectors of human activity on a scale never before seen, 
and enormous changes to policy. Individual action is not enough, but 
individuals will need knowledge, experience, and 
the moral authority that comes from setting examples of positive alternatives. 
So, if you are an 
individual scientist who wants to contribute, what can you do to cut your 
own carbon emissions in half? For many of us, it would require a single 
behavioral change: stop flying, because air travel is our single biggest 
source of carbon emissions, often dwarfing all other sources. This is 
certainly true for me, and it is likely true for many scientists in my 
field. In short: flying to conferences and other professional events has 
many direct and indirect costs.

Conferences cost the scientific community in other ways. 
[Independent scientists](https://twitter.com/deliprao/status/1040109386805309440) 
and those in the Global South often cannot attend due to cost. Some are 
prevented from attending by lengthy visa applications or [denied visas](https://medium.com/@hadyelsahar/highlighting-visa-issues-in-scientific-conferences-a4a1bab49dee). 
Scientists from underrepresented groups [are harassed and assaulted](https://medium.com/@kristianlum/statistics-we-have-a-problem-304638dc5de5). 
Women are more likely to face gendered expectations for family care that make
it difficult for them to travel.
In short, conferences are exclusive, and exclusivity keeps out those who 
might otherwise advance our field.[^1] 

So the cost of bigger and bigger NLP conferences is high. Let’s weigh that 
cost against the benefits. Why are conferences important for our field, 
or any scientific field?
* In NLP and related fields---mainly in computing---they are the primary 
  publication venues for scientific work.
* They are a major venue for more informal dissemination of scientific work 
  in the form of talks, posters, and hallway conversations.
* They are shared spaces where we meet other scientists, generate new ideas,
  and start new collaborations.

Are these benefits only possible with conferences? Consider:
* The conflation of publication and conference attendance is simply due to 
  the historical accident that [computer science came of age in the jet age](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext). 
  There are many other publication models, and academics love debating them 
  so I won't dwell on them here, except to say this: TACL ought to 
  solve this problem, but it doesn’t. It won't replace conference 
  publication a long as it so stingy with acceptances---most people resort 
  to conference submissions because TACL is unattainable. This deserves 
  rethinking.
* Talks are easily recorded, and indeed many recent NLP conferences have all 
  of their talks [online](https://vimeo.com/aclweb). Talks can and have 
  been [delivered remotely](https://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Post-conference_Breakfast_(ACL2018)), 
  but our conferences explicitly discourage this. They shouldn’t.
* Paradoxically, the growth in the number of conferences and the number of 
  researchers makes it less likely that you’ll actually meet the people in 
  the field that you hope to talk to. Simply going to one conference every 
  year or so means that you’ll miss meeting many of your fellow researchers 
  who went to one of the other 3-5 big conferences this year. But you can 
  confer with them year-round through any number of technologies, 
  public (e.g. social media) or 
  private (e.g. videoconference, chat, email, etc.). 

Personally, I’m skeptical of the idea that conferences are vital for 
intellectual exchange: of the many meetings I’ve attended over the course 
of my career, the number that substantially influenced my research has been 
very small. All of them were small events attended by a few dozen people 
who collaborated intensively in small groups for a week or more. That 
kind of focus is exactly the opposite of what we find in today’s enormous 
conferences. And, having collaborated successfully with 
remote partners several times over the past few years, I’m skeptical that 
this requires colocation. 

I'm sure it's healthy for scientific communities to collectively pause, 
take stock, learn about recent discoveries, and interact spontaneously with 
each other. The technology already exists to enable all of these things 
without flying across the world, even if it isn't cohesively packaged yet. 
Remote collaboration tools are not fully carbon neutral, but 
they are [far less damaging than flying](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2657142). Many climate scientists have
already [quit](https://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/life-after-oil/how-far-can-we-get-without-flying-20160211)
[flying](https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7659-565a), and
[some academics](https://academicflyingblog.wordpress.com/2018/09/11/the-climate-friendly-global-academic-conference-with-a-human-touch/) 
are already experimenting with virtual conferences. [Technologists have a role
to play in mitigating climate change](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/), 
and it is easy to imagine that we could iterate and scale virtual 
alternatives to conferences in just a few years. 

Obviously, there are many other ways you can reduce your carbon footprint 
and contribute to the enormous task ahead. But I was trained as a computer 
scientist, and I know that if you want to lower costs, you start with 
the biggest cost first because that’s where the biggest gains are. My goal 
isn’t to minimize other things you can do, and it isn’t to tell you to just 
stop conferencing. It’s an invitation: if you believe that the scientific
exchange that happens at conferences is important, how can you reimagine that exchange
to make it much less damaging to the environment and far more inclusive
than it is right now?

[^1]: Exclusivity was built into scientific conferences [from the beginning](https://www.visionlearning.com/en/library/Process-of-Science/49/The-How-and-Why-of-Scientific-Meetings/186#toc_2) and this needs to end.
